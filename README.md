# OpenCV-and-CNN-Sudoku-Solver-
In this project, given an input of a Sudoku image, we process the image to obtain the Sudoku and it's numbers. We then Solve it using Backtracking, and overlay the solution in the input image. The main work of this project is different techniques used in the processing of the input image, and the creation of a very good CNN model predictor.
